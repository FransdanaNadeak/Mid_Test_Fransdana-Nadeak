# Dataset Descrition
--------------
# Predict Apartment Price in Victoria Using Regression
### Background : 
The Dataset provides living area and conservation status.
There are 218 observations and 16 variables.

### Objective :
Create a python script for the Use Case below, please upload the script after you finish.
The Problem is to determine the best model and give the reason.

Tony who has profession as a broker wants to predict apartment price in Victoria based on living
area environment and apartment conservation status. Determine the best model to predict and
redefine new conservation variable in 3 level, A = 1A, B = 2A, C = 2B and 3A.

### The dataset is credited to Hipel an Mcleod, 1994.
# Background 
The Dataset provides the annual water usage in Baltimore from 1885 to 1963, or 79
years of data.
The values are in the units of liters per capita per day, and there are 79 observations.
# Objective  
Create a python script for the Use Case below, please upload the script after you finish.

# Background 
The dataset contains data for 887 of the real Titanic passengers. Each row represents
one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they
survived (S), their age (A), their passenger-class (C), their sex (G) and the fare they paid (X). The table
below shows the Data Dictionary.

# Objective 
Create a python script that contains the script to answer the questions below. Please put
comments on the script to show which line of codes answers which questions. Please upload the
script after you finish.
